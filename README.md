__pangeo-forge__ is an open-source tool designed to aid the extraction, transformation, and loading of datasets. The goal of pangeo-forge is to make it easy to extract datasets from traditional data repositories and deposit them into cloud object storage in analysis-ready, cloud-optimized format.

pangeo-forge is inspired by [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), a community-led collection of recipes for building [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) packages. We hope that pangeo-forge can play the same role for datasets.
