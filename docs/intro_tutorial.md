# Introduction Tutorial

Welcome to Pangeo Forge. This tutorial will guide you through producing your first analysis-ready, cloud-optimized (ARCO) dataset.

To create your ARCO dataset, you'll need to create a new recipe.

### Overview

1. [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the <https://github.com/pangeo-forge/staged-recipes> GitHub repository
2. Develop the recipe (see below)
3. Submit the new recipe as a pull request

At this point the pangeo-forge maintainers (and [a host of bots](https://github.com/pangeo-bot)) will verify that your recipe is shipshape and ready for inclusion in pangeo-forge.
See [](#maintaining) for more on what happens next.
