# Introduction Tutorial

Welcome to the Pangeo Forge introduction tutorial!

This tutorial is split into three parts:
1. Defining a recipe
1. Running a recipe locally
2. Setting up a recipe to run in the cloud

Throughout this tutorial we are going to convert NOAA OISST stored in netCDF to Zarr. OISST is a global, gridded ocean sea surface temperature dataset at 1/4 degree resolution. By the end of this tutorial sequence you will have converted some OISST data to zarr, be able to access a sample on your computer, and see how to propose the recipe for cloud deployment!

The introduction tutorial assumes that you already have `pangeo-forge-recipes` installed.
