## Connecting with the Community

Pangeo Forge is a community run effort with a variety of roles:

- **Recipe contributors** — contributors who write recipes to define the data conversions. This can be anyone with a desire to create analysis ready cloud-optimized (ARCO) data. To get involved, see {doc}`pangeo_forge_cloud/recipe_contribution`.
- **Bakery operators** — individuals or instituations who deploy bakeries on cloud infrastructure to process and host the transformed data. This is typically an organization with a grant to fund the infrastructure. For more information, see the Bakeries section of {doc}`pangeo_forge_cloud/core_concepts`.
- **Pangeo Forge developers** - scientists and software developers who maintain and enhance the open-source code base which makes Pangeo Forge run. See {doc}`pangeo_forge_recipes/development/index`.
