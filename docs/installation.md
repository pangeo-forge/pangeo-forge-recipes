# Installing Pangeo Forge Recipes

To get set up Pangeo Forge you'll need to install the `pangeo-forge-recipes` library. The recommended way to do that is with `pip`.

`pip install pangeo-forge-recipes`

If you want to get started right away, you'll also notice that all the tutorials have binder links. The binder links can be used to explore the library without setting up a local environment.
