# Pangeo Forge Cloud

Welcome to the Pangeo Forge Cloud documentation. While {doc}`../../pangeo_forge_recipes/index` may be {doc}`executed <../../pangeo_forge_recipes/recipe_user_guide/execution>` on private infrastructure, the ultimate aim of {doc}`Pangeo Forge <../../what_is_pangeo_forge>` is to create a crowdsourced catalog of datasets, alongside the {doc}`../../pangeo_forge_recipes/recipe_user_guide/recipes` used to build them, that is freely and publicly accessible to all. These pages document everything you'll need to know to contribute to this public catalog.
