# ** What is this this workflow? **
#
#   This resuable environment building and caching ("prepare-env") workflow adds some complexity
#   to our CI stack, in exchange for optimizing for speed. Other workflows which rely on it can
#   load cached environments without needing to build them from scratch.
#
# ** How do I use it? **
#
#   To load a cached environment built by this workflow in another workflow, please refer to
#   main.yaml in this directory, which demonstrates its proper use.
#
# ** Details **
#
#    This step builds and caches the test environments using conda.
#    If there is no cache, building each environment takes 3-4 minutes.
#    If there is a cache this step should take about 40 seconds.
#    (The time needed to install conda and check the cache.)
#
#    The cache key is as follows:
#    ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles( env.env_file ) }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}
#
#    A key parameter env.CACHE_NUMBER. This is a number that is set based on the current date:
#    CACHE_NUMBER=`expr $(date +'%j') / 3`
#    This is designed such that the cached environment will be reused for maximum 3 days.
#    After 3 days, the CACHE_NUMBER will increment, forcing a new environment to be built.
#    This cadence was chosen as a balance between making the tests go fast
#    (avoiding rebuilding environments every run), and using a fresh, recent environment.
#
#    The test environment is cached in /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/pangeo-forge-recipes
